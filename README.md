# Java Memory Game Project

## Intoduction
Welcome to our Java Project "Match Madness!" This is a card matching game that will challenge your memory!

## Compilation and Running
- First, ensure that you have the javac compiller installed on your device. This will be necessary to compile the project. The compilation methods may vary if another compiller is used.
- Then download all the programme files.
- If necessary, unzip the folder containing the files, then navigate to the folder containig these file in whichever IDE you intend to use.
- To compile the files from, enter into the IDE terminal
  ```
  javac *.java
- To run the game, enter
  ```
  java Main
- This should open a new GUI window. This window may be minimised and will need to me stretched wide enough to see the full diplay as shown below.
- Follow the instructions in the chat box, directly below the pale green "Submit" button to play the game.

## Notes
- For your convenience, there will be a printed answer list left in the standard terminal for you, to aid in testing the game without testing your memory!
- In the Class.java file, you'll find 1 undefined, commented-out, function referring to a specific task each card subclass was supposed to have. One of our reasons for using subclasses of Card, rather than just instances of Card, for the different card types was that we had hoped to include a special reaction to each card type. For example, we wanted our animal cards to output their sound to the chat box when selected, and our color cards to alter the colour of the game title, however in the end we were not able to implement these.
